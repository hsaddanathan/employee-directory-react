# Employee Directory

## Summary
In this assignment, we were tasked an employee directory using React. We were provided an API from [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), and we needed to populate the directory into a table. The table is sortable by name and searchable by city.

From there, open your terminal inside VS Code by using the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + `. 

Next, type "npm install" to install dependencies.
